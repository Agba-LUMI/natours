# Natours Project

The Natours Project is a full-stack web application developed using modern technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, ensuring a fast and scalable server architecture. MongoDB serves as the database, providing efficient data storage and retrieval.

For user authentication and authorization, JWT (JSON Web Token) is implemented, enabling secure access control. The application utilizes Pug as the templating engine to render dynamic web pages efficiently.

To enhance user interaction, Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) is integrated for sending automated emails, such as account verification and booking confirmations. Additionally, Paystack is used as the payment gateway, ensuring smooth and secure financial transactions
